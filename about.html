            My name is Emma Viitanen and I'm a 20 year old girl from Stockholm,
            Sweden.

            Back in Stockholm, I live with my mom Kristin, my dad Richard and my
            older sister Alexandra. We also have a cat called Gastón who is
            constantly in need of attention. Here in Jönköping I live in an
            appartment with four other students at JU. Thankfully we all get
            along
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I chose to study in Jönköping because of the education and the
            student life. Actually, last year I studied web programming at BTH
            but it got too complicated, too fast so now I'm focusing more on my
            design abilities.
